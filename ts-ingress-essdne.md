# Why does the Ingress status show an ESSDNE error?

When you check the status of your cluster's Ingress components by running the **`ibmcloud oc ingress status-report get`** command, you see an error similar to the following example.
{: tsSymptoms}

```sh
The secret is not present on the cluster or is in the wrong namespace (ESSDNE).
```
{: screen}

A secret created via the **`ibmcloud oc ingress secret create`** command was manually deleted from the cluster.
{: tsCauses}

If the secret is no longer needed, delete it. If the secret is still needed, reapply it to the cluster.
{: tsResolve}


- If the secret is no longer needed, run the **`ibmcloud oc ingress secret rm`** command to remove it from the managed secret list.
- If the secret is still needed, run the **`ibmcloud oc ingress secret update`** command to reapply the secret to the cluster.


If the issue persists, contact support. Open a [support case](/docs/account?topic=account-using-avatar). In the case details, be sure to include any relevant log files, error messages, or command outputs.
