# Why does the Ingress status show an `ERRSEIPM` error?

You can use the `ibmcloud oc ingress status-report ignored-errors add` command to add an error to the ignored-errors list. Ignored errors still appear in the output of the `ibmcloud oc ingress status-report get` command, but are ignored when calculating the overall Ingress Status.
{: tip}

When you check the status of your cluster's Ingress components by running the `ibmcloud oc ingress status-report get` command, you see an error similar to the following example.
{: tsSymptoms}

```sh
The service is missing one or more worker IPs (ERRSEIPM).
```
{: screen}

The service that exposes the default Ingress Controller does not have all the necessary worker IP addresses.
{: tsCauses}

Add the worker IP addresses to the external Ingress service.
{: tsResolve}

1. Run the following command and make note of your worker IP addresses in the `INTERNAL-IP` column.
    ```sh
    oc get nodes -o wide
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Run the following command to edit the service.
    ```sh
    oc edit service -n openshift-ingress router-external-default
    ```
    {: pre}

1. Add the IP addresses that you retrieved in step 1 to the `spec.externalIPs` list.

    If your cluster has many workers, you might not want to add all the IP addresses to the list. In this case, it is sufficient to add two IP addresses per zone. To see which worker belongs to which zone, look for the value of the `topology.kubernetes.io/zone` label in the output of the **`oc get nodes -o wide --show-labels`** command.
    {: tip}

1. Wait 10 to 15 minutes, then check if the warning is resolved by running the `ibmcloud oc ingress status-report get` command.

1. If the issue persists, contact support. Open a [support case](/docs/account?topic=account-using-avatar). In the case details, be sure to include any relevant log files, error messages, or command outputs.
