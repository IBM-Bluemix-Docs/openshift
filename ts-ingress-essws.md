When you check the status of your cluster's Ingress components by running the **`ibmcloud oc ingress status-report get`** command, you see an error similar to the following example.
{: tsSymptoms}

```sh
The secret status shows a warning (ESSWS).
```
{: screen}

There was an error when attempting to apply the secret to your cluster.
{: tsCauses}

To view the specific error, run the **`ibmcloud oc ingress secret ls`** commands and review the `Status` column.
{: tsResovle}

`Error api_request_failed`
:   There was an issue uploading the new certificate to the registered instance for the cluster. Verify the instance details using the **`ibmcloud oc ingress instance ls`** command.

`Error secret_apply_failed`
:   There was an issue applying the secret to your cluster. Follow the steps to [ensure your cluster control plane is healthy](/docs/openshift?topic=openshift-debug_master#review-master-health).

`Error namespace_not_found`
:   The namespace for the secret is no longer found in the cluster. If you no longer need the secret for that namespace, you can remove it with the **`ibmcloud oc ingress secret rm`** command. Otherwise, recreate the namespace on the cluster.

If the issue persists, contact support. Open a [support case](/docs/account?topic=account-using-avatar). In the case details, be sure to include any relevant log files, error messages, or command outputs.
